# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle used car dataset to uncover insights into pricing trends, vehicle types, and sales patterns. Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values and outliers, improving data quality. Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to showcase key findings.


+ **[Used Car Database](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database)** dataset has been taken from kaggle since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing **EDA**

+ The dataset is cleaned and stored in a **CleanData** folder which contains the entire cleaned dataset named as **[cleaned_autos.csv](CleanData/CleanedDataSet)** and another folder named **[DataForAnalysis](CleanData/DataForAnalysis)** containing files structures containing subsets of the cleaned dataset based on brand of the vehicles and vehicle types.

## Project Workflow

###  Data Exploration & Cleaning

+ Load the dataset and check for missing values.

+ Handle outliers (e.g., unrealistic prices, incorrect registration years).

+ Convert data types for consistency.

+ Save the cleaned dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

+ Analyze price distribution based on vehicle type.

+ Count vehicles for sale by brand and compare price variations.

+ Compare average prices and power across fuel types.

+ Identify trends in brand-wise average prices.

+ Analyze the time taken to sell vehicles online.

### Data Visualization & Insights

+ Generate histograms, boxplots, and bar charts.

+ Save visualizations for reporting.

### Automation & Optimization

+ Automate data cleaning and structuring.

+ Write reusable scripts for analysis.
